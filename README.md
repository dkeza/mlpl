Multilingual Programming Language - http://ivandejanovic.github.io/mlpl/

Multilingual Programming Language, MLPL, is envisioned as an introductionary programming language for children.

A problem with majority of programming languages in use today is that they require some knowledge of an English language and alphabet. Children from non-English speaking countries therefore have a higher barrier for entry than children whose native language is English.

Idea behind MLPL is to create an interpreter for a language with very simple syntax that can be easily localized. A programmer would beside source code file provide a file that contains all the keywords localized to programmer's native language. Thus, children from non-English speaking countries can start programming at much earlier age.

Example usage is mlpl mycode.mlpl mylocalization.cfg

Initial version of MLPL was heavily influenced by Kenneth C. Louden's implementation of a Tiny programming language as an example in a book Compiler Construction Principles and Practice by the same author. Large part of the initial code implementation was directly borrowed from the code Kenneth C. Louden provided in the book.
