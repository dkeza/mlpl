		<h1>MLPL - Multilingual Programming Language</h1>
		<div class="content_container">
			<h4>What is MLPL</h4>
			<p>A problem with majority of programming languages in use today is that they require some knowledge of an English language and alphabet. Children from non-English speaking countries therefore have a higher barrier for entry than children whose native language is English.</p>
			<p>Idea behind MLPL is to create an interpreter for a language with very simple syntax that can be easily localized. A programmer would beside source code file provide a file that contains all the keywords localized to programmer's native language. Thus, children from non-English speaking countries can start programming at much earlier age.</p>
