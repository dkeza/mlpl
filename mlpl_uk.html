		<h1>MLPL - Multilingual Programming Language</h1>
		<div class="content_container">
			<h4>What is MLPL</h4>
			<p>A problem with majority of programming languages in use today is that they require some knowledge of an English language and alphabet. Children from non-English speaking countries therefore have a higher barrier for entry than children whose native language is English.</p>
			<p>Idea behind MLPL is to create an interpreter for a language with very simple syntax that can be easily localized. A programmer would beside source code file provide a file that contains all the keywords localized to programmer's native language. Thus, children from non-English speaking countries can start programming at much earlier age.</p>

			<h4>Download</h4>
			<p>If you are using Linux you can download the package using this <a href="files/mlpl_linux_english.zip">link</a></p>
			<p>If you are using Windows you can download the package using this <a href="files/mlpl_windows_english.zip">link</a></p>

		<div class="content_container">
			<h4>Usage</h4>
			<p>If you are using Windows unpack the content of the package. Start the console and to to the directory to which you unpacked the package. You have a sample program you can run by executing
			<div class="console_container">
				<p>mlpl.bat sample.mlpl</p>
			</div>
			in the console. Open any text editor and write your program using the documentaion below. Save it to the same directory that contains the unpacked package. Run your program by executing
			<div class="console_container">
				<p>mlpl.bat your_program.mlpl</p>
			</div>
			from the console.</p>
			<p>If you are using Linux unpack the content of the package. Start the console and to to the directory to which you unpacked the package. You have a sample program you can run by executing
			<div class="console_container">
				<p>./mlpl.sh sample.mlpl</p>
			</div>
			in the console. Open any text editor and write your program using the documentaion below. Save it to the same directory that contains the unpacked package. Run your program by executing
			<div class="console_container">
				<p>./mlpl.sh your_program.mlpl</p>
			</div>
			from the console.</p>

			<h4>Documentation</h4>
			<p><strong>read:</strong> This command enables you to supply an integer for your program to process. The value you supply is placed in a variable.</p>
			<div class="code_container">
				<p>read x</p>
			</div>
			<p>The instruction above read a integer user types on a console and places it into variable x. If this instruction is not the last instruction in the block it has to be followed by a semicolon. If the instruction is the last instruction in the block it must not be followed by a semicolon.</p>
			<p><strong>write:</strong> This command enables you to write out a variable, integer or a string to the console.</p>
			<div class="code_container">
				<p>write x</p>
			</div>
			<p>The instruction above writes a value of the variable to the console.</p>
			<div class="code_container">
				<p>write 5</p>
			</div>
			<p>The instruction above writes a value of the variable to the console.</p>
			<div class="code_container">
				<p>write "message"</p>
			</div>
			<p>The instruction above writes a value of the variable to the console.</p> If this instruction is not the last instruction in the block it has to be followed by a semicolon. If the instruction is the last instruction in the block it must not be followed by a semicolon.</p>
